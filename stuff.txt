PROEJCT_SUMMARY
Project 1: Employee Productivity Dashboard
Summary:
This project involved designing a centralized dashboard to visualize employee productivity metrics across departments. The dashboard aggregates data from tools like Jira, Slack, and Google Calendar to provide insights into task completion rates, meeting hours, and active project timelines. It supports role-based views, weekly email digests, and real-time alerts for delays or low engagement. The goal was to enable managers to make data-driven decisions and support team optimization.

Project 2: Inventory Optimization System
Summary:
This project focused on streamlining warehouse inventory management through predictive analytics. A smart dashboard was developed to monitor stock levels in real time, flag surplus or low-stock items, and forecast future demand using historical data trends. The system integrates with the company’s ERP and automates reorder requests to vendors. As a result, inventory costs were reduced by 18%, and stockouts were minimized.
