Umm there are several issues that I faced while making this 

If I was using the agent to find optimal time directly with giving the schedules and people names requested, it still was leading to an issue so rathre I switched to manual mode to set the issue.
I have made it such that it will book on a particular date if mentioned otherwise it will book a meet today. 
There is  a file stuff.txt that ahs various things related to company like policies, holidays, projects etc.
The agent gets the data from that file and prints the output. 


Some things that can be improved is that:
The user should be able to know if when the particular person is available rather than just finding the optimal slot. 
More functionalities could be added.
